# Frontend Mentor's Four Card Feature Challenge

The web design of this project is not mine. This is my take on a challenge from frontendmentor.io, a website which contains numerous coding challenges for web developers. 

## My Style
My codes are inspired by CoderCoder's style of coding using SCSS. I tried to apply as much of it as I can without making the codes too complex for a simple design. I also followed Florin Pop's techniques as I built this webpage while trying to put in my own inputs. 

I still hope to improve my coding techniques and skills in the future!
